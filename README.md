## Time Series for Motion Mining

### Processing Motion

Below are the processing functionalities that the library contains:

* IMU-motion signals features extraction
* IMU-motion signals data augmentation 
* Processing and labeling time-series, with focus on motion
* Visualization of IMU-motion signals
* Visualization of time-series classification
* Dataset exploratory analysis and Visualization. 
* Dataset post-processing on different data fields (image, signals, audio, text):
  * Train/Test Split
  * Scaling: Normalization, Standardization, Gaussianization
  * Dimensionality Reduction: PCA

### AI Models

Here are presented the Neural Network models that are implemented for the 1D dimension, 
i.e. for the time-series analysis, including the corresponding citation for each one:
