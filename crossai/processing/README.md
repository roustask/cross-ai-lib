The fundamental modules for timeseries processing are defined here. 
**#TODO rename to `processing`**. Considerations for concatenating directory with `load_primitive_data` directory.

## dataset_exploratory_analysis
Functions for performing exploratory analysis on PAT motion sensors' gestures dataset.

## preprocessing_PAT
Preprocessing modules specifically applied on PAT dataset, according to the defined data schema.

## utils
Contains all the fundamental functions for processing, such as filters, STFT calculation, rolling window, etc.

## spikes_remove
Code explicitly for detecting and removing spikes in PAT gestures dataset. Badly written code, needs cleaning.
